Short answer: **no — don’t separate it.**
Long answer (why this is *correct* in Next.js):

### Why `page.js` has “HTML”

In **Next.js (App Router)**, `page.js` **is the page**.
The JSX you’re seeing *looks* like HTML, but it’s **React JSX**, not a static `.html` file.

This is the intended architecture:

```
/app
  /sign-in
    page.js          ← page + markup + logic
    page.module.css  ← styles
```

Separating it into a `.html` file would:

* ❌ break React state (`useState`)
* ❌ break client-side routing
* ❌ break form handlers (`onSubmit`)
* ❌ go against how Next renders pages (SSR / RSC)

So what you’re seeing is **exactly how it should be**.

---

### When *would* you separate things?

Not into `.html`, but into **components**.

Example (optional, later):

```
/sign-in
  page.js
  SignInForm.jsx
  page.module.css
```

Then `page.js` becomes:

```js
import SignInForm from "./SignInForm";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignInForm />;
}
```

That’s the *correct* way to “separate” — **not HTML files**.

---

### Why you still have `sign-in.html`

That file is a leftover from a static-HTML mindset. In Next:

* `.html` files are ignored by the App Router
* they’re safe to delete

You can remove:

* `sign-in.html`
* `sign-in.js` (if it’s old vanilla JS)

They’re doing nothing now.

---

### Bottom line

* ✅ JSX in `page.js` is correct and expected
* ❌ Don’t split into `.html`
* ✅ Split into React components *if* it gets big
* 🧹 You can delete old static files

You’re now using **real Next.js architecture**, not a hack.
